INSTALL for NightlyBuild

To adapt NightlyBuild for your system, it is proposed to follow the following steps:
Copy the file NBuserParametersDefault.py to the file NBuserParameters.py and adapt it to your preferences.
The NightlyBuild system executes first NBuserParametersDefault.py to get default values for all parameters.
Afterwards NBuserParameters.py is executed to overwrite parameter values with user-specific ones.
In NBuserParameters.py you can specify:
- the directory where the projects will be downloaded and built
- the list of projects to built
- the build types (optimized, debug, extra configure flags, ...) to built
- additional flags for the configure call that might be specific to your system (compiler setting,...)
- the name of a file where logging messages should go to
- information about the sending of email, e.g., should emails be send, your mail address, SMTP server, ...

Please read the comments in NBuserParametersDefault.py about detailed information which settings can be made and how they are specified.
To get things running properly, you will need to specify at least information about the sending of emails.

To build on Windows using the Microsoft compiler and the COIN-OR project supplied solution
files (.sln) the following hints may be useful:
- Subversion needs to be installed and runnable from a dos window command line.
  The following subversion install file has worked for this:
  http://subversion.tigris.org/files/documents/15/39559/svn-1.4.5-setup.exe
- Python needs to be installed and runnable from a dos window command line.
- The environment variables for accessing the microsoft compiler must be setup.
  Microsoft provides a script to do this:
  Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat
- The LIB environment variable needs to be set to the location of some MS provided libraries.
  The following commands have been used to achieve this:
  set LIB=E:\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Lib
  set LIB=E:\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\lib;%LIB%
- To build OS, the INCLUDE environment variable needs to be set to the location of some MS provided headers.
  The following commands have been used to achieve this:
  set INCLUDE=E:\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Include;%INCLUDE%


- A summary of the commands that have worked to start nightlyBuild from a DOS window are:
    "E:\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat"
    set LIB=E:\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Lib
    set LIB=E:\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\lib;%LIB%
    set INCLUDE=E:\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Include;%INCLUDE%
    f:
    cd \testScripts\
    nightlyBuild.py

Hints for  running nightlyBuild on windows with cygwin and gcc:
   Install cygwin. Be sure to select gcc, python, make

   Presently (1/12/2009) there is an issue with cygwin make 3.81.-1.
   For a fix see:
   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/current-issues
  
   Windows Control Panel - Scheduled Tasks:
     Run: F:\jp\COIN\testTools\nightlyBuild.cmd >temp.txt
     Start In: F:\jp\COIN\testTools

   nightlyBuild.cmd is:
     set PATH=F:\Programs\cygwin\bin;%PATH%
     F:
     chdir F:\Programs\cygwin\bin
     bash --login -s <f:\\jp\COIN\\testTools\\nightlyBuild.sh

   nightlyBuild.sh is:
     #! /usr/bin/env bash
     cd /cygdrive/f/jp/COIN/testTools; ./nightlyBuild.py
